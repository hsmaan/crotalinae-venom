# Crotalinae (Pit Viper) Venom Composition and Toxicity Correlation
In this exploratory analysis, the venom composition data for the Crotalinae subfamily will be used to investigate the correlation of genome evolution with venom composition and venom toxicity. This analysis contains the following: 
  
1. Determination of the optimal marker gene for phylogenetic tree
reconstruction using maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrapping.
      
2. Phylogenetic tree comparison using various tree distance measures, between
the marker-based evolution tree, and trees determined based on venom composition
and toxicity level.
      
3. Phylogenetic signalling analysis for venom composition and toxicity using Abouheif
Moran's I spatial auto-correlation, as well as a phylogenetic trait mapping for venom
toxicity level.
      
4. Considering phylogenetic signalling effects, phylogenetic generalized least
squares will be used to determine correlation between venom composition
factors and toxicity level. If signalling effects are not significant, other
correlation methods may be considered. 

This study aims to provide insight into the correlation between Crotalinae evolution, venom composition, and toxicity. Insights into how venom composition changes with evolution could be useful, as further analysis could closely examine these changes to find novel genes associated with venom proteome composition. Correlation between venom composition and toxicity could provide toxicological insights into how protein composition and protein-protein interactions contribute to overall toxicity. Therefore, this analysis could serve as a starting point for investigations of a greater scope.
